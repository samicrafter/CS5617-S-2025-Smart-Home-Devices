# üè† Smart Home - Interface Segregation Principle

This project is a simple Java application that demonstrates the **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**, one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design.

## Overview

**Interface Segregation** is a principle that states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. We achieve this by splitting large, "fat" interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

The smaller interfaces are specific to a certain functionality. This prevents classes from having to implement methods that are not relevant to them, promoting the **Single Responsibility Principle**, flexibility, and loose coupling in our code.

### Benefits

  * **Mix and match interfaces**: Classes can implement only the capabilities they need.
  * **Easy to maintain**: Changes to one interface don't affect classes that don't implement it.
  * **Increased flexibility**: It's simple to add new capabilities and new types of devices.
  * **Increased readability**: Code becomes self-documenting; the interfaces a class implements tell you exactly what it can do.
  * **Easier to test**: Smaller interfaces are easier to mock and test in isolation.

## Design

This project demonstrates the principle with two core components:

1.  **`Switchable` (Interface)**: A small, focused interface that defines the contract for any device that can be turned on or off.
2.  **`SmartLightBulb` (Class)**: A concrete class that implements the `Switchable` interface. It only needs to provide logic for turning on and off, keeping its design clean and simple.

This approach avoids forcing the `SmartLightBulb` to have methods it doesn't need, like `changeChannel()` or `setTemperature()`.

## The Principle in Code

Here‚Äôs a practical look at what the Interface Segregation Principle helps us avoid and achieve.

### ‚ùå The Wrong Way (A "Fat" Interface)

A single, bloated interface forces a simple plug to have a `setBrightness` method, which makes no sense.

```java
// BAD: This interface is too big.
public interface SmartDevice {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
    void setBrightness(int level); // Problem: What does a Smart Plug do here?
}
```

### ‚úÖ The Right Way (Segregated Interfaces)

We create small interfaces for each unique capability. A class can then implement only the ones it needs.

```java
// GOOD: A focused interface for on/off functionality.
public interface Switchable {
  void turnOn();
  void turnOff();
  boolean isOn();
}

// A simple light bulb only needs to implement this one interface.
public class SmartLightBulb implements Switchable {
    // ... implementation for on/off methods ...
}
```

## How to Run

This is a library-style project, so the main way to verify it is by running the unit tests.

### Prerequisites

  * Java (Version 17+)
  * Maven (Version 3.6+)

### Steps

1.  **Compile the code**
    Open your terminal in the project root and run:

    ```bash
    mvn compile
    ```

2.  **Run the tests**
    To confirm everything is working as expected, run the tests:

    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```

    You should see a `Process finished` message.
